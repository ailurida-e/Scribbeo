**Scope of Project**

The Chrome Extension provides a note-taking interface as well as a timed transcript of the notes taken previously for users to refer to while watching their videos.

**Motivation**

When you are rushing to take down notes from a video, it does take some time to adjust your notes application and the video to be beside each other.
In the end, we resort to switching between tabs or adjusting the size of our notes application multiple times as we are typing. Moreover, looking back at the notes, it is likely that we are confused as to what the context was in regards to the video.
To make it less of a hassle, we are intending to create a chrome extension that allows us to type down notes with the timestamps of the videos included - so your notes get highlighted at particular timestamps as the video is playing. Furthermore, the notes you type down also get automatically saved to Google Docs for you to refer to later on.

**Aim**

We hope to make the note taking and reviewing process while watching youtube videos easier.
